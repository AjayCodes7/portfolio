    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      This mobile app aims to digitalize the traditional financial lending process, particularly for local financiers who have relied on paper records for decades. It streamlines the loan application, documentation, approval, and recovery processes for both lenders and borrowers, providing an all-in-one digital platform for efficient loan management.
    </p>

    <h2>Project Concept</h2>
    <p>
      In many local communities, loan processes are still handled manually through face-to-face meetings and handwritten records. This app transforms that system by allowing lenders, supervisors, agents, and customers to manage everything digitally. Once the customer's details and documentation are uploaded, they donâ€™t need to submit them again for future loans. Loan applications, approvals, repayments, reminders, and histories are all handled within the app, making it a modern replacement for traditional ledger books.
